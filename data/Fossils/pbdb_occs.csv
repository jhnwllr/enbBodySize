The boundary between units C and B is formed by a marked unconformity (Fig. 6). At its present top, unit C is abruptly followed by the allochthonous unit B in which the original stratification of the laminates is strongly disturbed, showing folding, boudinage, lateral compression, and repetition by stapling.","lime mudstone","","lithified","","","","","","","","lagoonal/restricted shallow subtidal","passive margin","","","166","418","166","Clapham, M.","Karr, J.","Clapham, M.","2011-03-14 19:57:00","2013-12-02 23:55:11","","22.35","31.20","305"

The basin developed between the orogenic wedges of the Alps and Apennines during times of active structural evolution. The result was a complex physiography organized in sub-basins which, through time, hosted several mixed depositional systems characterized by different size, geometry, internal architectural styles and sedimentary facies associations.

While they include proofs of the presenceof the sea, they have preserved with marvellous perfection a large number of the plants which clothed the Alps, and of the insects which flitted through the woodlands. They form part of a great series of deposits which have been termed “Molasse” by the Swiss geologists...By far the larger portion of these strata is of lacustrine origin. They must have been formed in a large lake, the area of which probably underwent gradual subsidence during the period of deposition, until in Miocene times the sea once more overflowed the area. We may form some idea of the importance of the lake from the fact already stated, that the deposits formed in its waters are upwards of 6000 feet thick. Thanks to the untiring labours of Professor Heer, We know more of the vegetation of the mountains round that lake during Oligocene and Miocene time than we do of that of any other ancient geological period.

While they include proofs of the presenceof the sea, they have preserved with marvellous perfection a large number of the plants which clothed the Alps, and of the insects which flitted through the woodlands. They form part of a great series of deposits which have been termed “Molasse” by the Swiss geologists...By far the larger portion of these strata is of lacustrine origin. They must have been formed in a large lake, the area of which probably underwent gradual subsidence during the period of deposition, until in Miocene times the sea once more overflowed the area. We may form some idea of the importance of the lake from the fact already stated, that the deposits formed in its waters are upwards of 6000 feet thick. Thanks to the untiring labours of Professor Heer, We know more of the vegetation of the mountains round that lake during Oligocene and Miocene time than we do of that of any other ancient geological period.

The thicker biomicritic laminae contain silt-sized particles and foraminifera, ostracods, molluscs, and small thin-shelled gastropods. These biomicritic laminae are gradational with the micritic laminae, producing a graded bedding texture for each pair of laminae.

Detailed biostratigraphic investigations favor an uppermost Chattian age for the unit. Originally assigned a Miocene age, and then thought to be redeposited Baltic amber. The chemical composition of Bitterfeld amber is distinct from true Baltic amber (e.g., Sodhi et al., 2013). Hydrogen isotopes indicate that Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers have distinct geographic sources, but carbon isotopes and insects suggest Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers are coeval in age (Wolfe et al., 2016).","","amber","","lithified","","","","","","","","terrestrial indet.","","","","166","166","0","Clapham, M.","Clapham, M.","unknown","2014-10-17 21:46:46","2014-10-17 21:46:46","","16.42","45.24","305"
